**Serverless Student Management System** (SMS) is a modern student management platform, built entirely on AWS serverless services. This system helps schools or small businesses easily manage, analyze, and interact with student data on a small to large scale without worrying about hardware infrastructure.
Serverless components such as Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Amplify, ROUTE53, CloudFront, WAF help the system automatically scale, optimize costs, maintain high reliability and security.

- Users operate through the web interface (React/Amplify), interact with dashboards, assignments, and scoreboards.
- API backend (REST) ensures access to student data, personalized access.

- No need to manage traditional servers, the entire deployment and operation process – from storage, processing, to CI/CD – is integrated and automated through AWS services.

#### Workshop overview

In this workshop, you will:

- Initialize and configure AWS core serverless services: DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, Amplify, Cognito.
- Build and test a student management system with features: CRUD dashboard, service quality monitoring.
- Experience the DevOps CI/CD process automated from GitLab to AWS Pipeline, test and demo live the system.

- Apply practical knowledge to real lessons or similar projects, easily expand to mobile environments or integrate advanced AI.
