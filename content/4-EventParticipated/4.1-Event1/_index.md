> Overall, the event not only provided AI/ML knowledge but also helped me understand how to apply these technologies to real-world applications, opening up many possibilities for innovation.

#### Design Mindset

- **Business-first approach**: Always start from the business domain, not the technology  
- **Ubiquitous language**: Importance of a shared vocabulary between business and tech teams  
- **Bounded contexts**: Identifying and managing complexity in large systems  

#### Technical Architecture

- **Event storming technique**: Practical method for modeling business processes  
- Use **event-driven communication** instead of synchronous calls  
- **Integration patterns**: When to use sync, async, pub/sub, streaming  
- **Compute spectrum**: Criteria for choosing between VM, containers, and serverless  

#### Modernization Strategy

- **Phased approach**: No rushing — follow a clear roadmap  
- **7Rs framework**: Multiple modernization paths depending on the application  
- **ROI measurement**: Cost reduction + business agility  

### Applying to Work

- **Apply DDD** to current projects: Event storming sessions with business teams  
- **Refactor microservices**: Use bounded contexts to define service boundaries  
- **Implement event-driven patterns**: Replace some sync calls with async messaging  
- **Adopt serverless**: Pilot AWS Lambda for suitable use cases
