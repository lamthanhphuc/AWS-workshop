During my internship at **AWS** from **09/08/2025** to **12/09/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge I acquired at university in a real working environment.  

I participated in the **Serverless Student Management System** project as the Back End developer, through which I developed and improved skills such as **programming, requirements analysis, architecture design, event handling, report writing, and technical communication with the team**.

Regarding work ethic, I always strive to complete assigned tasks, comply with regulations, and proactively communicate with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

## Achievements

- Gained an understanding of **multi-layer serverless architecture** operating on AWS.  
- Understood the **Cognito authorization model**, and real-time processing via **AppSync WebSocket**.  
- Directly developed modules for **CRUD, chat, student ranking, and event-based email sending**.  
- Practiced **DevOps CI/CD pipeline** automating the build → test → deploy process.
