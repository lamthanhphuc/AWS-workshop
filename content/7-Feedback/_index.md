### General Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always ready to help when I encounter difficulties, even outside of working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, which helps me focus better. However, I think it would be beneficial to add more events to provide additional knowledge.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor is very enthusiastic, always listens, and explains clearly when I raise questions. The admin team supports with procedures, documents, and creates favorable conditions for my work. I highly appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answers.

**3. Suitability Between Work and Major**  
The tasks assigned to me are suitable for the knowledge I learned at school, while also expanding into new areas I had not encountered before. This helped me both reinforce my foundational knowledge and learn practical skills.

**4. Opportunities for Learning & Skill Development**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and how to communicate professionally in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared a lot of real-world experience, helping me better orient my career.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still has fun. Everyone strives together and supports each other regardless of position. This made me feel like a part of the team, even as an intern.

### Suggestions & Wishes
- All the team members are very enthusiastic and always guide me, from registering at the office, finding cheap parking, to recommending good and affordable lunch spots.
- There should be a clearer schedule so that future interns can better prepare for tests and keep up with project progress.
- Since AWS Cloud is currently one of the most powerful tools, interning here will help you understand all aspects of AWS Cloud—not only how to use it, but also how to optimize operations and costs.
