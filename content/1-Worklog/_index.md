# Worklog

## Overview

During my **12-week internship** at First Cloud Journey (from 08/09/2025 to 09/12/2025), I completed the AWS learning program and developed the **Serverless Student Management System** project.

### Phase 1: Learning AWS Fundamentals (Weeks 1-7)

In the first 7 weeks, I focused on learning and practicing core AWS services:

| Week | Topic | Skills Acquired |
|------|--------|------------------|
| 1 | AWS Fundamentals | Understanding Cloud Computing, AWS Global Infrastructure |
| 2 | IAM & Security | Creating Users, Groups, Roles, MFA, Budget Alerts |
| 3 | VPC Basics | Designing Subnets, Route Tables, IGW, NAT Gateway |
| 4 | VPC Security | Configuring Security Groups, NACLs, VPC Peering |
| 5 | Hybrid Networking | Transit Gateway, Route 53 Resolver, Hybrid DNS |
| 6 | EC2 | Instance Types, AMI, EBS, Auto Scaling Groups |
| 7 | Storage | AWS Backup, Storage Gateway, S3 Static Website |

### Phase 2: Developing Proposal Backend (Weeks 8-12)

In the last 5 weeks, I developed Backend APIs for the student management system:

| Week | Task | Result |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 8 | Analysis & Design | Architecture diagram, API design, DynamoDB schema |
| 9 | Class & Student APIs | 5 APIs: CRUD Class, List Students |
| 10 | Assignment & Grade APIs | 5 APIs: CRUD Assignment, Update Grades |
| 11 | Post API & Testing | 1 API, Integration tests, API documentation |
| 12 | Deploy & Demo | Deploy AWS, Proposal document, Presentation |
