### Week 5 Achievements:

* Successfully practiced AWS Transit Gateway:
  * Created Transit Gateway to connect multiple VPCs
  * Created Transit Gateway Attachments for each VPC
  * Configured Transit Gateway Route Tables
  * Updated VPC Route Tables to use Transit Gateway
  * Tested connectivity between VPCs via Transit Gateway

* Compared Transit Gateway vs VPC Peering:
  * Transit Gateway: Hub-and-spoke model, scalable, centralized
  * VPC Peering: Point-to-point, not transitive

* Mastered Amazon EC2 theory:
  * Types of Instance Types and use cases
  * What is AMI and how to create custom AMI
  * EBS volumes and types (gp2, gp3, io1, io2, st1, sc1)
  * Instance Store vs EBS
  * User Data to bootstrap EC2
  * Metadata service to get instance information
  * EC2 Auto Scaling concepts
